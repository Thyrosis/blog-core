# To Do

## High priority (or 'Fix it NOW')

- None for now.

## Medium Priority (or 'Just get on with it')

- Media management (as in CDN functionality). Upload and delete files, then make them available in the post editor.
- Create a 'Tutorial' document. Just in case someone needs to use it aside from myself.

## Low Priority (or 'Well, if you ever have some time left')

- Static pages for types. Which is not really needed, as the menu kinda gives you the option to make a post 'static'. Still, it would be nice to have different options for pages as opposed to posts. Like a page doesn't have an author, nor can you comment on it. It can have a different template.

# Finished

- Strip tags for RSS feed summary. It breaks things like Facebook and MailChimp. (High, 20190108)
